Hey bestie
When you text me
I feel better than I've been
It took a week for me to sink my teeth directly in your skin
When I hold your hand in public, people always stare at us
It's funny cuz its obvious and fun to just not give a fuck
Hey bestie
Would you let me
Permanently your life
I got attached, way too fast
Miss you so much I already cried
It's been 2 days since I've seen your face
And we've texted the whole time
I feel pathetic and dependent
When i overthink us at night
Make it to your place on a quarter tank
Idle in the street, scanning for your face
Haven't left my house since I moved to LA
Now you give me reasons to go to every place
Spent more money than i have
I was living slow now I'm moving fast
Shocked how quick i got attached
Texted you that I miss you I meant that
Hey bestie
When you met me
Did you think it'd go this well
I've never been, this fucking deep
Intwined with someone else
Spend half the week at ur apartment, you spend the other half at mine
Keep my phone by my side when we're apart
Never gotten this far
Hey bestie
Do you love me?
Hey bestie
When you text me
I feel better than I've been
It took a week for me to sink my teeth directly in your skin
When I hold your hand in public, people always stare at us
It's funny cuz its obvious and fun to just not give a fuck
